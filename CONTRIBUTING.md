## Releasing a new version

To release a new version you can follow these steps:

1. Bump the [version](lib/gitlab/qa/version.rb#L3) using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
   * You may find it helpful to fill out the description of the merge request 
     using the same format as for existing [tags](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/tags), as this will help in
     step 3.
2. Pull the change locally and run `bundle exec rake release` to build, tag,
   and push the new version to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/gitlab-qa).
   * Note: you will need an account on [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/)
     and permission to push `gitlab-qa`. Open an issue in this project to
     request access.
3. Update the release notes for the new [tag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/tags).
4. If any pipelines are locked to a specific version, update them if required.
